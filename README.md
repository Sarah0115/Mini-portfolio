# Portfolio

A beautiful, responsive one-page portfolio built with Vue 3 to showcase three fictional projects.

I tried to go fast, simple and actually show some interactivity, built with Vue, vite and Sass, since I feel very comfortable with them, and wanted to stay simple.

Went for cats directly because why not but there are pictures of actual projects somewhere.
